   implement thread_sleep() line 220

once we make thread_sleep(), call it in timer_sleep().
then we must call "thread_foreach()." thread_foreach will allow us to iterate through the entire list, check which threads are 
blocked, and decrement time needed to sleep for by 1 tick.

we have already added a new datatype in the threads struct.

unblock the thread when time is <= 0.
########### MUST DO ###################
    Take out of sleep_list ( DO THIS )

put timer_forsleep in a place where you know how many ticks 
have passed, we have to relate it between timer and thread files.

Look @ all the comments 
possibly thread_tick (void)
